# NLP_Basic Pre- Processing Of Any Text Data.
 ### Basic Pre-Processing of Natural Language Processing
  ## Importing Library 
      >import nltk : nltk library is used in NLP for text data processing 
	
	> Tokenization : Tokenization is used in natural language processing to split paragraphs  into single word or sentence  that can be 				more easily assigned meaning. 
      > Types of Tokenization : 1) sentence tokenization 
					  2) Word tokenization 
					  3) whitespace tokenization

 ## Normalization text data 
	> We have to convert text data into single case i.e convert data into lower case as it is an standard in industry.
 ## Remove Punctuation 
	> We have to remove all special character and all numrical while preprocessing then that cleaned data can be ussed for furtur 		  application 
 ## Remove Stopward 
	> We have to remove all special character and all langauge specific stopword and domain specific stopword while preprocessing then 		  that cleaned data can be ussed for furtur application
 ## Contraction Mapping  
	> Contractions are words or combinations of words that are shortened by dropping letters and replacing them by an apostrophe.
		For Example : 
			Input : "I didn't like the movie" 
			Output :'I did not like the movie'
 ## Lemmatization 
	> Lemmatization of word means we can extract meanigful root word form word net dictionary    
            For Example : 
			Input : "Runnig" 
			Output :'Run'
